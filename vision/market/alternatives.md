Diagramming Tools Market
------------------------

## Visio

Visio is the encumbent system, as it is packaged with Microsoft Office and has been around for many years.  
I have no idea how many copies of this are sold - but it must be in the tens of millions.

Visio has 18,500 likes on facebook, compared to 60,000 with Microsoft Word. I don't know if this says much – I would say that there are a lot of people using Visio – many millions.

## Gliffy

Gliffy is a diagramming tool implemented along the lines of Visio but
running as Software-as-a-Service. 

They have been in existence for around 6 years, and started off
as a flash implementation though have completed a reengineering to move
Gliffy to use HTML5 (as Kite9 does), so that it can be run on an iPad.

This will enable them to tap into the iPad market. 

They apparently have a user base of 'millions', but since they offer a free product, it is hard to say how much revenue they generate from this.

They have a model whereby you can create a limited number of personal
diagrams for free.

If you want to collaborate on diagrams then you need to pick one of the paid plans at either $5 or $10 per month.

## Creately

Creately is very similar to Gliffy, although provides desktop and
server-based versions of their software to purchase too.

While they charge less for purchasing user licenses in bulk, these start at $5 each. They also claim to have a
user base of millions, and have been going for 9 years.

There are a plenty of other perfectly capable pieces of software which
follow this same Visio-style approach that I could list.

## yEd

yEd is made by yWorks (<http://www.yworks.com>) software.

It is a free diagramming tool along the lines of the others listed here. 

However, yEd is not the main focus of yWorks.

They are a graph visualisation company who maintain a library for graph layouts of various kinds, both force-directed and orthogonal.  They appear to specialise in implementations of published pre-existing layout algorithms.

yEd embeds the yWorks layout routines, but in an optional way: You can position the elements yourself
and then call the layout routine to arrange them for you.

You would think this would be the holy grail, but unfortunately the results are underwhelming and the approach falls into the 'Psychological Hardness' trap I describe [here](hard).

yEd is given away free.  This is because it is neither fish nor fowl:  it's not good enough at automatic layout of orthogonal diagrams to make that a selling point, and that's because it's not the core focus
of the company.

As a diagramming tool it is not in the same league as Creately or Gliffy.

As a graph visualisation tool it competes with Gephi, which is free and
more capable in its niche.

According to the introductory video, yEd was downloaded over ½ million times in 2010.  This implies that there is a large demand for the kind of software.  

But given the lack of recent innovation in the tool and the fact that it's free, it also implies that this software doesn't deliver on the promise.
