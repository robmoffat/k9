SWOT Analysis
=============

Strengths
---------

The proprietary Kite9 layout algorithms (which have been many years in
development) would take many years for a competitor to match.

A visually appealing Graphical User Interface (GUI) for building
diagrams, based on HTML5 web standards. 


Almost zero fixed costs, and low variable costs (everything is digital).

Diagrams are made to be shared. 
There is an innate viral nature about producing a Kite9 diagram,
especially if it is labelled with the Kite9 logo.

Weaknesses
----------

Because no other tools effectively perform the function of Kite9, it is
hard to persuade people that this time it works.

The market will need education to see the benefits of this approach
(though Line Management got it straight away)

Although all the hard parts have been implemented, the GUI tool is a
proof-of-concept and still lacks basic functionality such as a library
of symbols or diagram management and versioning functionality.

There is a learning curve:if
you�re expecting it to be Visio, it�s going to be initially confusing.

For very large diagrams, the algorithms become expensive and time
consuming to run.However, no
optimisation work has been attempted yet, and plenty of low-hanging
fruit exists.Also, large
diagrams are in many cases not the right answer.

Opportunities
-------------

Kite9 is hard to reproduce.  Anyone seeing it and wanting to copy it will have an uphill
battle to match the functionality.

People are moving away from the desktop, and towards the iPad.  

iPad is somewhere where Kite9 would really shine because you are not capable of arranging symbols as
accurately with a finger as you can with a mouse.

Producing a really good UML tool might be a good inroad, although we
would need to match the symbol library.

Banking regulations:  it's now a key regulation that banks must produce data lineage for their systems.  Kite9 is an ideal tool for this.  (more here)  

Threats
-------

Gliffy (or someone else) could try and implement our features, but
actually I don�t think it would be in their interests to try this, as
they would end up in the optional-layout trap that yEd falls into.

The unique features of Kite9 don�t turn out to be the differentiator
that we hope they are.

How to address the market for this tool?
