Kite9 In Action
---------------

Kite9 has been used privately, at the small scale.  The reason for this is that it means we can get the most possible feedback about what is missing from the tool.

Throwing it out "to the internet" obviously means more eyeballs, but the quality of the feedback is much lower.

## Medtronic

As part of a consultancy project to build a new internal website, I had
to put together a change process with one of my clients.

We could have used Visio to do this, but with Kite9, we saved a lot of time. 

He was based in Switzerland, so I shared my screen with him using
GoToMeeting, and fired up Kite9 in a browser.

We collaborated on producing the process flow diagram shown in Appendix
2: Kite9 UI Generated Diagram, below. 

Although the diagram might not mean much to you, it worked for us, and
because Kite9 laid it out as we went along, there wasn't any wasted time
during the meeting.A much larger
portion of our time was spent on discussing the content of the diagram,
and very little on how it looked.

## Aura Software

Working with a business partner at Aura Software, we put together rafts of high-level designs for his business project, Bright.  We shared them back and forth and changed each other's work. 

He preferred this tool to all of the other UML tools he had used thus
far, despite the fact that at the time the algorithms were not as robust
as they are now, and there is still at present scant diagram management
functionality.

Aura has many diagrams in Kite9 now.
