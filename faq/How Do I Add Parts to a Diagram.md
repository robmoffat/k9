title: How Do I Add Parts To A Diagram?
---

Parts are one of the types of element you can put on a diagram.  Parts
have a shape, and text associated with them.  Once you have parts on
your diagram, you can link them up together with links, like so:

To add a part, you must drag it off the chooser, which will pop down
when you click the “add...” button on the menu, like so:

When you drag the element off the chooser, it will disappear, allowing
you to choose somewhere to place the element on your diagram.  By
default, Kite9 has “auto-connect” enabled, which suggests connections
you could make to other parts of the diagram. 

  

Auto-Connect suggestions appear when you move your new element above,
below, to the left or the right of an existing element on the diagram.
 This indicates that the new part will be fixed in relation to that
other, existing element.

In the diagram above, you can see auto-connect working:   “New Part” is
the part being dragged.  Because “New Part” is close to the top of
“Another Part”, “Another Part” is highlighted, and a link is shown
between the two elements.  

  

When we let go of the new element, the diagram is redrawn to tidy up the
layout.

This means you don’t have to be precise about where you put things in
Kite9: the tool is clever enough to keep track of the directed layouts
you ask for.

  

If you put something in the wrong place, don’t worry.  You can either
**undo** the change, or you can drag the parts around the diagram to
change your layout.
