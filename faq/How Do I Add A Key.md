title: How Do I Add A Key?
---

Lots of diagrams (and maps) rely on symbols and keys to convey
information.  For example, an element will have a symbol attached to it,
which is then explained in the key.  This can be done in Kite9 too.

  

**What Are Symbols?**

**  
**

At the moment, Kite9 supports 3 kinds of symbols: diamonds, hexagons and
circles, and each can have a different character within them.  It is up
to you what they mean.

**  
**

Most elements (labels, parts, text lines) support symbols, as you can
see in this image:

**Adding or Changing a Symbol**

**  
**

As an example, let’s change the symbol Circle-“C” on the image.
 Double-click the label to edit it (or click **Edit** on the context
menu):

The edit popup will appear:

Click the symbol to get the symbol pop-up to appear:

You can select (or multi-select) symbols from this list, or create a new
one with the **new** popup:

After selecting the “N” symbol, the diagram will redraw with the new
symbol.

  

**Adding A Key**

**  
**

Keys can be created by clicking the diagram background to get the
context menu, and then clicking the **Add Diagram Key** symbol:

A key will be added like this, which you can edit:

Add some text-lines to describe what your symbol mean, using the edit
dialog:

Your diagram will redraw with the new information:
