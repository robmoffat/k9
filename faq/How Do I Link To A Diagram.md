title: How Do I Link To A Diagram?
---

Once you are happy with a diagram you’ve been working on, you can
publish it for the world to enjoy.  

  

This means is that the diagram will be available at a given **URL** (Web
Address) for people to access.  

  

There are two types of publication available in Kite9, and you’ll need
to choose which sort you want up front:

  

-   **FIXED:  **This means that the publication has a version number
    (starting with version 1).  You’ll never be able to change version 1
    again, but you will be able to publish subsequent versions of
    the diagram.
-   **ROLLING:** This means that you will be able to update the
    publication as you go along.  People visiting the diagram will see
    changes you make.

  

It is possible to have several different publications (of different
types) for a given diagram.

  

From your **Diagram Settings** page, click on **Publications** then
**New Publication.  **You will need to fill in the form:

The **stub** is a few short characters which will be used in the URL
(you can leave this blank and one will be generated for you).

  

One you click “create”, a page will appear containing the details of
your publication.  At the bottom of the page, there is a **URL** for the
diagram which you can share with others. 

  

There are also buttons on the navigator to shortcut sharing on Facebook
or Twitter.
