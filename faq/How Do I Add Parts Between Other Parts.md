title: How Do I Add Parts Between Other Parts?
---

Let’s say you have two parts on your diagram linked together like this:

But, you want to change the diagram so that there is a further part in
between “From” and “To”.  Maybe something that describes what the link
means between these two things.

  

You can do this by dropping a new part onto the link. 

  

To do this, select a new part from the **add…** menu, like so:

In this example, we are going to add the new black “Connection Body”
element.

  

Drag this over the link, so that the link is highlighted “through” the
element you are dragging:

Then, let go and the diagram will re-arrange to contain this new
element:
