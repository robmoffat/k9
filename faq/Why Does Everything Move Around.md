title: Why Does Everything Move Around?
---

When you place new elements into your diagram, Kite9 will automatically
try to layout your diagram as best it can to accommodate the changes. 

 

The idea behind Kite9 is that diagram layout is a job best done for the
computer.  

  

**But, how can I control where things go? **

**  
**

Kite9 allows you to define how elements in the diagram are positioned
relative to one another.  You can do this with:

  

-   Container Layouts
-   Directed links
-   Aligning Elements

  

**But This is Really Confusing!**

  

Sometimes, it can be.  But, try and get used to it.  Why not spend a bit
of time trying to break Kite9, or playing with how it works?  It’s
actually quite fun.

  

Also, think of the effort you are saving:  no more having to change the
shape of boxes so that they are the right size to hold their text.  No
more having to select elements and re-align them if the diagram changes.

  

Once you get used to it, it will massively speed up your work, and open
doors to some really impressive possibilities.
