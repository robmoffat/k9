title: How Do I Tell If A Link Has A Direction Set?
---

Links on your diagrams can either have a fixed direction (e.g. UP to
DOWN, or LEFT to RIGHT) or be free to choose their own direction.

  

Links that are added by auto-connect have a fixed direction.  

  

Links that you draw on yourself are free.

  

You can check this on a link by clicking the link and checking the
direction icon.  The one below is UP/DOWN:

Whereas this one is LEFT/RIGHT:

And this one is not fixed, as indicated by the wiggly arrow:

  

![](link_direction3.png)

  

When the arrow is shown in red, this means that the direction is set,
but it causes a contradiction on the diagram.  That is, there is another
link direction or layout which is overruling it:

The best approach is to move the elements of the diagram around to fix
the contradictions.  

  

In the case of a contradiction, usually, the link directions you set
last will overrule earlier ones.
