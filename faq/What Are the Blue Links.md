title: What Are The Blue Links?
---

Sometimes, you will see blue links connecting elements on your diagram
like below:

These blue links will not appear on any final rendering of your diagram,
but are there to show you that there is a layout constraint between
these two elements.  In this case “To” has to appear above “New Part”. 

  

You can remove these in the normal way, but then the diagram will
re-arrange:

Deleting the blue link will change the diagram to this:
