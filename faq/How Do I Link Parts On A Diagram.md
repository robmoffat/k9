title: How Do I Link Parts On A Diagram?
---

It is easy to link up parts of a Kite9 diagram.  First, click the “link”
button on the menubar:

Then, hover the mouse over the part you want to link from.   If the part
supports linking, it will be highlighted, like the “4” part here:

Then, drag to where you want the link to connect to (in the picture
below, the “2” part):

When you let go, Kite9 will re-arrange the elements of your diagram to:

  

-   Minimize crossings of links
-   Minimize distance of the links
-   Tidy up the layout so links go in straight lines

  

Like so:

Once you have created some links on your diagram, you can:

-   Experiment by labelling the ends of the links.
-   Changing the colour or line-style of the link.
-   Changing the shape of the link’s terminators.
-   Force a link to go in a particular direction.
