# Kite9: The Vision #

## Introduction ##

Kite9 is a tool for drawing diagrams.  Specifically, diagrams showing how systems connect and work.  

Kite9 is designed to address multiple [problems](problems/README.md) that exist in the world of software diagramming, by taking a different approach:   it *enforces* an automatic layout for each diagram in the system.

This sounds problematic, because actually, automatic layout is very tricky to get right and is an open problem in computer science.

However, Kite9 contains custom algorithms which push forward the state-of-the-art, and make this a viable proposition.  

Once you have consistent, always-on automatic layout, [lots of new benefits appear](unique_features.md).

## Who Is It For? ##

Kite9 is designed primarily for organizations consisting of many software teams working in complex, heterogeneous environments.  It is designed to be collaborative, and be used concurrently by an entire organisation.

Read more about the [use cases here](use_cases.md).  

## Development Status ##

Kite9 already exists in [beta](http://kite9.com).  Many of the key elements have been written in at least first-draft form.  The hardest element ([automatic diagram layout](design/layout.md)) is now proven technology.

**You can log in and try it right now, for free.**  But, expect that functionality will change *a lot*, according to our road-map.

In order to turn Kite9 into a complete diagramming solution, it must be fleshed out with features already present in other diagramming tools.

You can see the existing Kite9 working [here](http://kite9.com).

## Market

There are lots of diagramming tools on the market, but Kite9 tries to do something different.  Read about the difference [here](market/README.md).
