# What Is Kite9 For?

## 1.  The Business Analyst

A business analyst often needs to draw diagrams, both of the **current** state of the world, and **potential future states**.

Working with Kite9, they can create a project to manage these diagrams, saving lots of time over traditional tools (because Kite9 is doing the layout for them).   

They also benefit from version control, and enforced consistency between the different diagrams in their project.

They benefit from being able to draw various different types of diagram, since Kite9 extensibly supports a wide range via Schemas and Palettes.

## 2.  The Developer

Developers can use Kite9 in the same way as described above, if they want to.  But there is more.  Since Kite9 has an API, they can instruct their build tools to post diagrams to Kite9 *as the software is developed*.  This means that the business analysts have an up-to-date view on exactly what the state of the software is, not just some out-of-date documentation.

Because Kite9 automatically lays out diagrams, the developer can concentrate on the simple task of sending Kite9 just the details about the entities that are needed.

## 3.  A Development Team

Within a development team, it's often hard to know where to start, or what the overall architecture of the system is.  By tying the diagrams to the code, Kite9 is an always-up-to-date model of exactly what is checked into the codebase *now*.

## 4.  Organisational Architecture

Because Kite9 supports *composition* and multiple teams, it's possible that the whole organisation can work together to contribute diagrams to the project.  An architect can work then on composing the individual diagrams into views of the entire organisation.

Architects can work directly with information provided by developers or business analysts, rather than having to gather it themselves.  The software will support different *opinions* on how the architecture looks, and support a *data dictionary* for the entities it knows about to resolve cases where teams give different names to the same things.

With Kite9, you can build up a living model of the entire enterprise, created from the collaborative efforts of all the teams working on the software.
