# The Problem #

There are 3 problems that Kite9 is trying to address:

### 1.  Software Diagramming Is Still Lame ###

#### Manual Tools


#### Poor Automatic Layout


#### Poor Interactivity Support


#### Not Designed For Extensibility


#### Not Even Designed For the Internet


### 2.  The Types of Diagrams We Produce Are Poor

#### UML


#### Object Orientation


#### "The Muddle Of UML"

7 items I talked about before:  impedance mismatch, tool mismatch, layout difficulties, reverse engineering


### 3.  Diagramming vs. Collaboration

Most enterprise in the computing world is collaborative, and most of the tools we use allow collaboration.

For example, when I check code into the source control system, I can be doing this at the same time as other 
developers.  Sometimes, (if we make conflicting changes) this causes an issue.  But the mark of good source
control software is that it allows the developers to solve these issues with as little pain as possible.
