# Sprints Removed From The Plan

As we've gone along, various sprints have become unnecessary:


<strike>
### We need to send our object model to JSON.

- This is going to be a lot of JSON.
- It should be about creating groupings, setting paths and setting styles + classes.
- Everything that was in the original object model, plus layout information.

*(Removed 13/4/2016)*

</strike>

<strike>
### Styling

- React should pass through the style tag to the JSON elements for inclusion on the diagram.
- Write a test to make sure this happens.

*(Removed 11/5/2016)*
</strike>

<strike>
### CSS

- Write a Kite9 CSS file, which will be also loaded up by the react component.
- Turn off the style element coming from Kite9:  can we replace this with CSS class?

*(Removed 13/5/06)*
</strike>


<strike>
### Client-Side CSS

- Get React to render the client using the same css file.
- Write some tests for this somehow to check itâ€™s correct.

*(Removed 11/5/2016)*
</strike>


<strike>
### Symbols Using Grid Layout

- Write a test that shows some symbols, each having a class, inheriting their outline shape, colour etc.  and being rendered correctly.
