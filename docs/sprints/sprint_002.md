# Sprint 2:  Markdown and  GitHub Pages #

For this sprint, I want to get the documentation in order for Kite9, so that each time I *do* some 
sprint documentation, it's got somewhere to live.

 - Sprint Articles on Github Pages
 - Some Kite9 website should point to the documentation.
 - Some vision documents
 - Decomissioning info.kite9.com, and moving all the help articles off there.
 

## Step 1:  Placeholders 

I already have the text from the last sprint, so it's not a million miles away in terms of content.  All that's required is to push this to github and try to configure pages.  So far, i have this structure:

```
./help
./sprints
./sprints/images
./sprints/images/001_1.png
./sprints/sprint_001.md
./sprints/sprint_002.md
./vision
./vision/layout.md
./vision/problems.md
./vision/README.md
./vision/unique_features.md
```

## Help Documentation

So, I am missing some 'help' documentation.  I still have this from the old Kite9.  It's on a Wordpress blog served at info.kite9.com, and I initially wrote it using Evernote.  (There is a great Wordpress/Evernote sync plugin for Wordpress that I am using).  

After looking for an Evernote export, and finding nothing, I am thinking the answer might be exporting it from Wordpress.



## GitHub Pages

Once I commit my changes, everything is visible on Github.  However, it's not as nice as GitHub pages would look, so the next job is to set that up.

## Re-pointing the URL

I need to move across info.kite9.com to it's new, GitHub Pages location.  

## Vision Documentation

A lot of the material about Kite9 is looking kind of old, and actually, I don't really want to keep it.  What I need is to clearly explain:

1.  The Shortcomings of existing tools
2.  Why Kite9 addresses these shortcomings.
3.  Why this is credible.
4.  What these tools empower, in terms of further functionality.
5.  Why this has a strong business case.
6.  The architecture of the new Kite9, and what that enables.
