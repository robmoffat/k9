# 2nd February 2018: Sprint 15: Command Pattern

- Insert element (id, id-less xml bits)
- Modify element (id, what it looks like after, before)
- Remove element (id)
- Set attribute
- All basically stuff that allows you to manipulate XML (this allows palettes to work).
- After posting the command, it should return the new JSON (for react), or an error message should pop up. redux can handle that.
- Commands should attempt to apply to the active diagram.
- Load
