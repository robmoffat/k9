Links on your diagrams can either have a fixed direction (e.g. UP to
DOWN, or LEFT to RIGHT) or be free to choose their own direction.

  

Links that are added by auto-connect have a fixed direction.  

  

Links that you draw on yourself are free.

  

You can check this on a link by clicking the link and checking the
direction icon.  The one below is UP/DOWN: 

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Tell%20If%20A%20Link%20Has%20A%20Direction%20Set_.resources/link_drection1.png" width="1262" height="796" />

  

Whereas this one is LEFT/RIGHT:

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Tell%20If%20A%20Link%20Has%20A%20Direction%20Set_.resources/link_direction2.png" width="1300" height="734" />

  

And this one is not fixed, as indicated by the wiggly arrow:

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Tell%20If%20A%20Link%20Has%20A%20Direction%20Set_.resources/link_direction3.png" width="1444" height="572" />

  

When the arrow is shown in red, this means that the direction is set,
but it causes a contradiction on the diagram.  That is, there is another
link direction or layout which is overruling it:

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Tell%20If%20A%20Link%20Has%20A%20Direction%20Set_.resources/link_direction6.png" width="1056" height="1006" />

  

The best approach is to move the elements of the diagram around to fix
the contradictions.  

  

In the case of a contradiction, usually, the link directions you set
last will overrule earlier ones.
