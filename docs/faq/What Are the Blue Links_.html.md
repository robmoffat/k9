Sometimes, you will see blue links connecting elements on your diagram
like below:

  

<img src="What%20Are%20the%20Blue%20Links_.resources/blue1.png" width="1006" height="464" />

  

These blue links will not appear on any final rendering of your diagram,
but are there to show you that there is a layout constraint between
these two elements.  In this case “To” has to appear above “New Part”. 

  

You can remove these in the normal way, but then the diagram will
re-arrange:

  

<img src="What%20Are%20the%20Blue%20Links_.resources/blue2.png" width="1108" height="618" />

Deleting the blue link will change the diagram to this:

<img src="What%20Are%20the%20Blue%20Links_.resources/blue3.png" width="1594" height="382" />
