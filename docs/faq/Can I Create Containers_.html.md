On a KIte9 diagram, you can create containers for other elements very
simply by multi-selecting some elements and clicking on the “container”
icon, shown below. 

  

<img src="Can%20I%20Create%20Containers_.resources/containers-1.png" width="674" height="474" />

  

This has the effect of adding a container for the selected elements,
like so: 

  

<img src="Can%20I%20Create%20Containers_.resources/containers-2.png" width="668" height="464" />

You can add labels to containers, change the shape or colour of them or
change their layout.

  

You can link a container to other elements on the diagram, like so:
