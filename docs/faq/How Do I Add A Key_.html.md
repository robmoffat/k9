Lots of diagrams (and maps) rely on symbols and keys to convey
information.  For example, an element will have a symbol attached to it,
which is then explained in the key.  This can be done in Kite9 too.

  

**What Are Symbols?**

**  
**

At the moment, Kite9 supports 3 kinds of symbols: diamonds, hexagons and
circles, and each can have a different character within them.  It is up
to you what they mean.

**  
**

Most elements (labels, parts, text lines) support symbols, as you can
see in this image:

**Adding or Changing a Symbol**

**  
**

As an example, let’s change the symbol Circle-“C” on the image.
 Double-click the label to edit it (or click **Edit** on the context
menu):

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Add%20A%20Key_.resources/symbols2.png" width="686" height="374" />

**  
**

The edit popup will appear:

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Add%20A%20Key_.resources/symbols3.png" width="1292" height="386" />

  

Click the symbol to get the symbol pop-up to appear:

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Add%20A%20Key_.resources/symbols4.png" width="808" height="924" />

  

You can select (or multi-select) symbols from this list, or create a new
one with the **new** popup:

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Add%20A%20Key_.resources/symbols5.png" width="808" height="598" />

  

After selecting the “N” symbol, the diagram will redraw with the new
symbol.

  

**Adding A Key**

**  
**

Keys can be created by clicking the diagram background to get the
context menu, and then clicking the **Add Diagram Key** symbol:

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Add%20A%20Key_.resources/symbols11.png" width="1302" height="750" />

A key will be added like this, which you can edit:

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Add%20A%20Key_.resources/symbols8.png" width="1246" height="756" />

Add some text-lines to describe what your symbol mean, using the edit
dialog:

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Add%20A%20Key_.resources/symbols9.png" width="1244" height="1086" />

  

Your diagram will redraw with the new information:

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Add%20A%20Key_.resources/symbols10.png" width="1190" height="354" />
