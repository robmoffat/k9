Let’s say you have two parts on your diagram linked together like this:

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Add%20Parts%20Between%20Other%20Parts_.resources/link_drop1.png" width="842" height="568" />

But, you want to change the diagram so that there is a further part in
between “From” and “To”.  Maybe something that describes what the link
means between these two things.

  

You can do this by dropping a new part onto the link. 

  

To do this, select a new part from the **add…** menu, like so:

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Add%20Parts%20Between%20Other%20Parts_.resources/link_drop2.png" width="1030" height="784" />

  

In this example, we are going to add the new black “Connection Body”
element.

  

Drag this over the link, so that the link is highlighted “through” the
element you are dragging:

  

 <img src="How%20Do%20I%20Add%20Parts%20Between%20Other%20Parts_.resources/link_drop6.png" width="812" height="564" />

Then, let go and the diagram will re-arrange to contain this new
element:

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Add%20Parts%20Between%20Other%20Parts_.resources/link_drop4.png" width="1332" height="556" />
