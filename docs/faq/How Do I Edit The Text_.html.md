Let’s say you add a new Part to your diagram. You do this by dragging it
from the chooser: 

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Edit%20The%20Text_.resources/part_edit1.png" width="642" height="408" />

To change the text “New Part” into something more meaningful, either
**double-click** the Part, or click once to bring up the context menu,
and click the pencil to edit:

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Edit%20The%20Text_.resources/part_edit2.png" width="844" height="454" />

This will bring up the part edit screen, like so:

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Edit%20The%20Text_.resources/part_edit3.png" width="1248" height="1108" /> 

  

At the moment, there’s a limited number of things you can do to a part,
but let’s add some text-lines, a divider and a type, like this:

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Edit%20The%20Text_.resources/part_edit4.png" width="1256" height="1108" />

  

When you click **OK**, the diagram will be re-rendered.  Your Part will
change size to accommodate the new text you’ve added to it:

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Edit%20The%20Text_.resources/part_edit5.png" width="752" height="576" />
