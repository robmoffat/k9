It is easy to link up parts of a Kite9 diagram.  First, click the “link”
button on the menubar:

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Link%20Parts%20On%20A%20Diagram_.resources/link.png" width="686" height="278" /> 

Then, hover the mouse over the part you want to link from.   If the part
supports linking, it will be highlighted, like the “4” part here:

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Link%20Parts%20On%20A%20Diagram_.resources/Screen%20Shot%202015-07-08%20at%2017.48.54.png" width="622" height="668" />

Then, drag to where you want the link to connect to (in the picture
below, the “2” part):

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Link%20Parts%20On%20A%20Diagram_.resources/link_end.png" width="656" height="624" />

When you let go, Kite9 will re-arrange the elements of your diagram to:

  

-   Minimize crossings of links
-   Minimize distance of the links
-   Tidy up the layout so links go in straight lines

  

Like so:

  

<img src="How%20Do%20I%20Link%20Parts%20On%20A%20Diagram_.resources/link_rearranged.png" width="738" height="712" />

Once you have created some links on your diagram, you can:

-   Experiment by labelling the ends of the links.
-   Changing the colour or line-style of the link.
-   Changing the shape of the link’s terminators.
-   Force a link to go in a particular direction.
