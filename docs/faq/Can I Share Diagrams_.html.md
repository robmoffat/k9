Once you have created a project (and added some diagrams to it), you
will be able to share all of the diagrams in the project with
collaborators. 

  

Click on the **Members** button on the left side of the project screen,
and you will be able to see who your project is currently shared with.

There are three “roles” within a project:

  

-   **Member:  **A project member can make changes to the diagrams, add
    new diagrams and publish diagrams.
-   **Viewer:**  A viewer can’t make any changes to a project, but can
    view the diagrams within it.
-   **Admin:**  As with member, but can also make changes to the
    membership of the project

  

To add a new member to the project, you just need an email address for
the member.  Click the “Invite Member” button and fill out the form
below:

The added user will receive an email telling them that they have a new
project in Kite9 to collaborate on.
