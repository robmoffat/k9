There are several ways to add containers to a diagram.  By selecting
elements and pressing **Group** on the context menu, or by pulling off
containers from the chooser (shown below).

Having added a container, it is possible to change the container layout,
by choosing the “layout” option from the context menu as seen here:

You can then choose a new layout from the popup window:

If I choose “Top To Bottom”, the diagram will redraw like this:

**Changing The Order**

  

With a layout specified, you can re-order the contents of the container
by dragging the elements around inside it.  The blue bar shows the new
position the element will have, and gives you a visual clue that the
container has a layout set.
