# Interaction

We're going to try and apply a couple of rules:

 - All the heavy lifting happens on the server side.
 - But, the server side doesn't process any third-party code
 - Defaults over choices
 
## Adding an element to the diagram

- Click on the diagram, up pops a context menu.
- Click the plus symbol, which has a small icon attached to it.  A new diagram element is added.
- Click the element, and select the chooser, and you can change the shape of the element.
- Click the label and enter a new title in the chooser.

## Adding a linked element

- Click the element, up pops a context menu.
- Click the add button, and you are given a new element to drag around.
- The new element is the same shape as the last element shape you used / put in the cut buffer
- The link is likewise the same link you most recently used
- A new link is suggested via the auto-connect logic.

## Changing The Element Without Adding One

- If you don't have an element selected, the chooser will just change the **last used element.**
